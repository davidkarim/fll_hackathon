During the 2016 first annual Code for Fort Lauderdale Hackathon, @davidkarim and I paired to work on some traffic citation data provided by the City of Fort Lauderdale police department.

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks I used to turn the raw data into geojson formatted data suitable for display in a `MapBox GL JS heat map`_.
